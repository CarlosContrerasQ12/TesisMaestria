We formulate large population stochastic flocking problem as a dynamic game problem in which the agents have similar dynamics and are coupled via their nonlinear individual cost functions. These cost functions are based on the Cucker-Smale (C-S) flocking algorithm in its original uncontrolled formulation. For this nonlinear dynamic game problem we derive a set of coupled deterministic equations approximating the stochastic system of agents as the population goes to infinity. Subject to the existence of a unique solution to this system of equations, the set of {MF} control laws for the system possesses an εN-Nash equilibrium property, where εN → 0 as the population size, N, goes to infinity. Hence, this model may be regarded as a controlled game theoretic formulation of the C-S flocking model in which each agent, instead of responding to an ad-hoc algorithm, obtains its control law from a game theoretic Nash equilibrium. Moreover, we retrieve the {MF} Linear-Quadratic-Gaussian ({LQG}) dynamic game solution for the C-S algorithm from the general nonlinear {MF} system of equations.},

Roughly speaking, we are concerned with situations that involve a very large number of “rational players” with a limited information (or visibility) on the “game”. Each player chooses his optimal strategy in view of the global (or macroscopic) informations that are available to him and that result from the actions of all players. In the three examples we mention here, we derive a mean-field problem which consists in nonlinear differential equations. These equations are of a new type and our main goal here is to study them and establish their links with various fields of Analysis. We show in particular that these nonlinear problems are essentially well-posed problems i.e., have unique solutions. In addition, we give various limiting cases, examples and possible extensions. And we mention many open problems.},

It aims to produce a coherent text beginning for simple notions of deterministic control theory progressively to current Mean Field Games theory. The framework gradually extended form single agent stochastic control problems to multi agent stochastic differential mean field games. The concept of Nash Equilibrium is introduced to define a solution of the mean field game. To achieve considerable simplifications the number of agents goes to infinity and formulate this problem on the basis of {McKean}-Vlasov theory for interacting particle systems. Furthermore, the problem at infinity is being solved by a variation of the Stochastic Maximum Principle and Forward Backward Stochastic Differential Equations. To elaborate more the Aiyagari macroeconomic model in continuous time is presented using {MFGs} techniques},

	abstract = {This paper aims to answer the research question as to optimal design of decision-making processes for autonomous vehicles ({AVs}), including dynamical selection of driving velocity and route choices on a transportation network. Dynamic traffic assignment ({DTA}) has been widely used to model travelers’ route choice or/and departure-time choice and predict dynamic traffic flow evolution in the short term. However, the existing {DTA} models do not explicitly describe one’s selection of driving velocity on a road link. Driving velocity choice may not be crucial for modeling the movement of human drivers but it is a must-have control to maneuver {AVs}. In this paper, we aim to develop a game-theoretic model to solve for {AVs}’ optimal driving strategies of velocity control in the interior of a road link and route choice at a junction node. To this end, we will first reinterpret the {DTA} problem as an N-car differential game and show that this game can be tackled with a general mean field game-theoretic framework. The developed mean field game is challenging to solve because of the forward and backward structure for velocity control and the complementarity conditions for route choice. An efficient algorithm is developed to address these challenges. The model and the algorithm are illustrated on the Braess network and the {OW} network with a single destination. On the Braess network, we first compare the {LWR} based {DTA} model with the proposed game and find that the driving and routing control navigates {AVs} with overall lower costs. We then compare the total travel cost without and with the middle link and find that the Braess paradox may still arise under certain conditions. We also test our proposed model and solution algorithm on the {OW} network.},

Following the idea of fictitious play, we recast the \$N\$-player game into \$N\$ decoupled decision problems (one for each player) and solve them iteratively. The individual decision problem is characterized by a semilinear Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, to solve which we employ the recently developed deep {BSDE} method. The resulted algorithm can solve large \$N\$-player games for which conventional numerical methods would suffer from the curse of dimensionality. Multiple numerical examples involving identical or heterogeneous agents, with risk-neutral or risk-sensitive objectives, are tested to validate the accuracy of the proposed algorithm in large group games. Even for a fifty-player game with the presence of common noise, the proposed algorithm still finds the approximate Nash equilibrium accurately, which, to our best knowledge, is difficult to achieve by other numerical algorithms.},

Mean field games have been introduced to study Nash equilibria for such problems in the limit when the number of players is infinite. The theory has been extensively developed in the past decade, using both analytical and probabilistic tools, and a wide range of applications have been discovered, from economics to crowd motion. More recently the interaction with machine learning has attracted a growing interest. This aspect is particularly relevant to solve very large games with complex structures, in high dimension or with common sources of randomness. In this chapter, we review the literature on the interplay between mean field games and deep learning, with a focus on three families of methods.

	abstract = {We present a method enabling a large number of agents to learn how to flock, which is a natural behavior observed in large populations of animals. This problem has drawn a lot of interest but requires many structural assumptions and is tractable only in small dimensions. We phrase this problem as a Mean Field Game ({MFG}), where each individual chooses its acceleration depending on the population behavior. Combining Deep Reinforcement Learning ({RL}) and Normalizing Flows ({NF}), we obtain a tractable solution requiring only very weak assumptions. Our algorithm finds a Nash Equilibrium and the agents adapt their velocity to match the neighboring flock's average one. We use Fictitious Play and alternate: (1) computing an approximate best response with Deep {RL}, and (2) estimating the next population distribution with {NF}. We show numerically that our algorithm learn multi-group or high-dimensional flocking with obstacles.},

	abstract = {This project investigates numerical methods for solving fully coupled forward-backward stochastic diﬀerential equations ({FBSDEs}) of {McKean}-Vlasov type. Having numerical solvers for such mean ﬁeld {FBSDEs} is of interest because of the potential application of these equations to optimization problems over a large population, say for instance mean ﬁeld games ({MFG}) and optimal mean ﬁeld control problems. Theory for this kind of problems has met with great success since the early works on mean ﬁeld games by Lasry and Lions, see [29], and by Huang, Caines, and Malhamé, see [26]. Generally speaking, the purpose is to understand the continuum limit of optimizers or of equilibria (say in Nash sense) as the number of underlying players tends to inﬁnity. When approached from the probabilistic viewpoint, solutions to these control problems (or games) can be described by coupled mean ﬁeld {FBSDEs}, meaning that the coeﬃcients depend upon the own marginal laws of the solution. In this note, we detail two methods for solving such {FBSDEs} which we implement and apply to ﬁve benchmark problems. The ﬁrst method uses a tree structure to represent the pathwise laws of the solution, whereas the second method uses a grid discretization to represent the time marginal laws of the solutions. Both are based on a Picard scheme; importantly, we combine each of them with a generic continuation method that permits to extend the time horizon (or equivalently the coupling strength between the two equations) for which the Picard iteration converges.},

These two methods diﬀer in the order in which optimization and passage to the limit are performed. When optimizing ﬁrst, the asymptotic problem is usually referred to as a mean-ﬁeld game. Otherwise, it reads as an optimization problem over controlled dynamics of {McKean}-Vlasov type. Both problems lead to the analysis of forward-backward stochastic diﬀerential equations, the coeﬃcients of which depend on the marginal distributions of the solutions. We explain the diﬀerence between the nature and solutions to the two approaches by investigating the corresponding forward-backward systems. General results are stated and speciﬁc examples are treated, especially when cost functionals are of linear-quadratic type.},
