When we deal with deterministic optimal control problems there are two approaches one involving Bellman's dynamic programming principle and the other relying on the Pontryagin's maximum principle. The former approach leads to a partial differential equation named the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bell equation, while the latter leads to a system of ordinary differential equations which are defined backward in time.
